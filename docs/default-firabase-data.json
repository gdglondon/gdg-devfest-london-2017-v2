Google Analytics has also radically changed moving away from website pageviews allowing you to analyse virtually any event on any platform. This talk is designed to highlight some of the Google Analytics features available to developers you may not be aware of inspiring you to look at your analytics problems and opportunities in new ways. For example, we look at how Google Analytics can be used as part of the Internet of Things, using low cost computing like Raspberry Pis for recording and analysing everything from sensor data to physical switches. We also look at bridging offline and asynchronous tracking sending measurement data in batches when connectivity is reestablished as well as pushing data from third party APIs into Google Analytics using free tools. After this talk you'll hopefully look at Google Analytics in a completely different way.",
